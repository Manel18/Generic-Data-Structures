# Generic-Data-Structures
This repo will contain my implementation of various data structures.
(Still in development, there's a lot to be done.)

My objective is to implement as many data structures as I can, that work for every data type. So that i can have them prepared and use them use them for future projects.

Somethings could DEFINITELY be done better, so lets treat them as rough sketches ;)

All of them are missing error checking, im leaving that for later, sorry ;)

The following work (at least with (not extensive) tests i made):

-> Linked List (needs cleaning)

-> Queue

-> Stack

-> Hash Table

In development: 

-> Heap (max and min, in the works)
